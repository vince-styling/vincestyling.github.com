It all started in the summer of ‘09, when developer mastermind Petr met Robin, a sought-after designer & entrepreneur. The two realized they shared a passion for a new technology that was changing the way the world communicated: the iPhone app. Petr had the coding expertise, but no flair for design. Robin’s design skills were on-point, but he needed more structural savvy. Together, they were a killer combination and they teamed up immediately.

    String word = "hello world";
    for(int i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
        System.out.println("we are at war");
    }
    private void hideGlobalMenu() {
        if (mGlobalMenu != null) {
            mGlobalMenu.dismiss();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
        if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
            hideGlobalMenu();
        }
        return super.dispatchTouchEvent(event);
    }

## What did you say?

Two months later they launched `Cookmate`, their first app. When Cookmate took 1st place at the LeWeb Conference in December 2009, Robin & Petr knew they were on to something. They decided to create their own company—one dedicated to hand-crafting apps that were as aesthetically beautiful as they were seamlessly functional in every little detail.

The company started taking on clients, and slowly but surely built up a team of the brightest talent in the industry. Word began to spread, and Tapmates grew steadily for about a year. In the winter of 2010, Tapmates created an unsolicited redesign of a hot new photo app called Instagram... That helped to gain the right attention. Interested developers and Silicon Valley startups began reaching out with offers and prospects.

With offices in NYC and the Czech Republic, **Tapmates** is thanks to the team full of enthusiastic people making the smartphone world a more beautiful place. One lovingly-built app at a time.
