        <p>It all started in the summer of ‘09, when developer mastermind Petr met Robin, a sought-after designer &amp; entrepreneur. The two realized they shared a passion for a new technology that was changing the way the world communicated: the iPhone app. Petr had the coding expertise, but no flair for design. Robin’s design skills were on-point, but he needed more structural savvy. Together, they were a killer combination and they teamed up immediately.</p>

<pre><code>String word = "hello world";
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 120; i++) {
    System.out.println("we are at war");
}
private void hideGlobalMenu() {
    if (mGlobalMenu != null) {
        mGlobalMenu.dismiss();
    }
}

@Override
public boolean dispatchTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
    if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {
        hideGlobalMenu();
    }
    return super.dispatchTouchEvent(event);
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="whatdidyousay">What did you say?</h2>

<p>Two months later they launched <code>Cookmate</code>, their first app. When Cookmate took 1st place at the LeWeb Conference in December 2009, Robin &amp; Petr knew they were on to something. They decided to create their own company—one dedicated to hand-crafting apps that were as aesthetically beautiful as they were seamlessly functional in every little detail.</p>

<p>The company started taking on clients, and slowly but surely built up a team of the brightest talent in the industry. Word began to spread, and Tapmates grew steadily for about a year. In the winter of 2010, Tapmates created an unsolicited redesign of a hot new photo app called Instagram... That helped to gain the right attention. Interested developers and Silicon Valley startups began reaching out with offers and prospects.</p>

<p>With offices in NYC and the Czech Republic, <strong>Tapmates</strong> is thanks to the team full of enthusiastic people making the smartphone world a more beautiful place. One lovingly-built app at a time.</p>
